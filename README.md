# vehicleTraf-Object-detection-mohitmb


In this system, we provide a method for detecting objects and vehicle traffic in real-time using computer vision algorithms. Modern object detection techniques are used to identify vehicles and other things, and our suggested solution entails tracking their motion over time. The outcome of our system is observed using an interactive web-based interface that displays object and traffic movement in real-time inside the monitored region. Our system offers a reliable and practical solution for real-time object and vehicle detection.
